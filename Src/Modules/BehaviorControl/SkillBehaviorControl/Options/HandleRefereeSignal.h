/**
 * @file HandleRefereeSignal.h
 *
 * This file defines options that handle the in-game referee detection.
 * A robot only tries to look at the referee if in a preliminary game and the
 * robot stands inside a ring segment surrounding the referee position when a
 * new game state starts. The robot will not try to actively reach such a
 * position. Since the referee signal is not shown earlier than 5 s after the
 * state change, the robot continues its normal behavior for 3 s, before
 * it turns around to look at the referee.  It will then not wait longer than
 * 10 s until it returns to normal game play. If the referee was not detected
 * within the first 6 s, a side step will be performed. The robot usually
 * steps closer to the halfway line to get a more perpendicular view at the
 * referee. However, if already close to the halfway line in the own half, it
 * will walk in the opposite direction to avoid entering the opponent half.
 * The referee signal "substitution" consists of two gestures. It will be
 * detected in sequence. If the first part is detected but the second one is
 * not, a default substitution message is sent, which is at least the correct
 * signal and with a chance of 1/2 also the correct team color.
 * The first part of "substitution" can also be mixed up with one of the
 * two gestures for "fullTime". Therefore, substitution can still result in
 * "fullTime" if that one is detected later.  The gesture for goal can be
 * detected by accident. Therefore, sending is  delayed to give this
 * robot and other robots the chance to come up with a  different signal.
 * If the referee gesture has not been detected within 10 s, the robot will
 * send a wildcard gesture, which grants a 6/13 chance of guessing the right
 * team color. The wildcard is a two handed signal, of which only two exist,
 * so it has a slightly higher chance of being correct if the three
 * categories are used at similar frequencies.
